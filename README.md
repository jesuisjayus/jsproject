### Project Description

This teamwork was carried out within the framework of the ELP project (___E___*cosystèmes des* ___L___*angages de* ___P___*rogrammation*, programming 
language ecosystems) taught in the telecommunication department of INSA Lyon. ([more about JS project](https://github.com/sfrenot/javascript/blob/master/ProjectDesc.md))


The aim of this project is to learn the basics of 3 programming languages(JS ,[Go](https://github.com/jesuisjayus/goproject "goproject") & [ELM](https://github.com/jesuisjayus/elmproject "elmproject")) and to produce a functional program.

As far as JS project is concerned, we simply had to create a **C**ommand-**Line** **I**nterface, able to execute some basic command lines.

### How to run and use the program 

0. First, make sure NodeJS is installed on your device (if not, check this [page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
1. Download the code and unzip it
2. open the terminal in the folder 
3. Type `node shell`, you are now using our **CLI**
4. First, you can use the `help` which displays all the features available

#### Notable details : 
* coded and tester under Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
* we didn't manage to execute a program undetached, it seems that `open` execute a detached program. So, the `CTRL+P` combination does exit the **CLI**, however programs open with `open` don't close
